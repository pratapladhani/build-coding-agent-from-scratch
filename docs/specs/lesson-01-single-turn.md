# Single turn

Ask for one prompt, send it to the model, print the reply, and exit.

This lesson is already built for you. Read `src/index.ts` first — it is six lines, and it is
the whole agent. Then read the two files it leans on. Every later lesson grows out of these
three.

## Key concept

There is no magic underneath a coding agent. One turn is one HTTP request: you send messages,
you get a message back. Everything else in this workshop is built on top of that single call.

## The shape

`src/index.ts` says what the agent does, and nothing about how. Terminal handling lives in
`src/cli.ts`, the model call in `src/llm.ts`. Keep it that way — when a later lesson makes
`index.ts` hard to read at a glance, the new detail belongs in one of the other two.

Each module is imported whole — `import * as cli from './cli.js'` — so the agent reads
`cli.ask()` and `llm.complete()`. Every verb says where it comes from without you scrolling
back to the imports, and the import block doubles as the list of parts.

| File           | Owns                                                     |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/index.ts` | the agent, in the fewest lines that still say it          |
| `src/cli.ts`   | reading a prompt, printing a reply, ending on Ctrl-D      |
| `src/llm.ts`   | the API key, the model, and the HTTP call                 |

## Requirements

- Run it with `npm start`.
- Read `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` from the environment, via `.env`.
- If the key is missing, print a short error and exit non-zero.
- Ask the user for one prompt, labelled `You:`.
- Use `OPENROUTER_MODEL`, or `minimax/minimax-m3:free` if it is unset.
- Print the reply, labelled `Assistant:`.
- Exit after the reply.

## Example

Run `npm start`, then try:

```text
You: What is the capital of France?
Assistant: The capital of France is Paris.
```

One reply, then the program exits.

## Acceptance test

```sh
npm test -- lesson-01
```

## Pressure test

Run `npm start`, ask one question, then try to ask a second one.

You cannot. The program has already exited, so every question needs a fresh process — and a
fresh process means a fresh `npm start` for every single thing you want to say. That is why
the next lesson wraps this in a loop.
