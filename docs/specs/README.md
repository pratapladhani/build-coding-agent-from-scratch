# Specs

One spec per lesson. Work down the ledger: find the first row marked `Todo`, read its spec,
build it, make its acceptance test pass, then mark it `Done`.

| Lesson | Spec                                                      | Status |

| 04     | [Read file](lesson-04-read-file.md)                       | Done   |

Lesson 01 arrives already built, so you have a working agent to change on your very first
step.

## Status

- `Todo` — not started
- `WIP` — in progress
- `Done` — complete, and its acceptance test passes

## Spec structure

Each spec is short and the same shape:

```md
# Title without the lesson number

One sentence describing the goal.

## Key concept

One short paragraph naming the idea this lesson teaches.

## Requirements

Observable behavior only, including inherited behavior when it matters.

## Example

A runnable manual check: the prompt, and what you should see.

## Acceptance test

The command that proves it.

## Pressure test

A concrete scenario exposing the weakness that motivates the next lesson.
```

The `Pressure test` is the point of the whole sequence: each lesson ends by showing you what
it still cannot do, which is what the next lesson fixes.
