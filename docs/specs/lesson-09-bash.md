# Bash

Give the agent a shell, so it can run your build and read what came back.

## Key concept

A shell is the tool that closes the loop. Until now the agent could read your code and change
it, but nothing it did was ever checked — it changed a file and told you to go and run the
tests. With a shell it runs them itself, reads the output and keeps going.

Your terminal is invisible to the model. A command that fails prints in red and exits non-zero,
and none of that reaches the model unless you put it in the string you send back. So a failing
command is not an error in your program — it is an ordinary result, and the exit code is the
only way the model knows it happened.

## Requirements

- Keep everything lesson 08 does.
- Send a third tool with every request: `bash`, taking a single string `command`.
- Run it with `bash -c` and answer the call with stdout and stderr interleaved, followed by the
  exit code.
- A command that exits non-zero is a result, not a crash. Report it and carry on.
- Cut the output off after about 8000 characters and say that you did — a stray `cat` of a big
  file is a context window, spent.
- Kill a command still running after 30 seconds and say so, or the first command that waits for
  input hangs the agent with no explanation on screen.
- If a tool throws — a missing path, a bad argument — answer the call with the reason instead of
  dying. That is one line in `src/tools/index.ts` and it covers every tool, not just this one.
- `src/tools/bash.ts` owns the new tool. `src/tools/index.ts` gains the dispatch key and the
  catch. `src/index.ts`, `src/tools/read-file.ts` and `src/tools/edit-file.ts` do not change.

## Example

Run `npm start` in this repo, then ask for the thing lesson 08 could only half-do:

```text
You: make ask() in src/cli.ts return the input trimmed, then run the tests
→ read_file {"path": "src/cli.ts"}
→ edit_file {"path": "src/cli.ts", "oldText": "heard(line.value);", "newText": "heard(line.value.trim());"}
→ bash {"command": "npm test"}
Assistant: Done. ask() now passes the trimmed input to heard(), so whitespace is stripped
before it is logged and returned. All 15 tests across 9 files pass.
```

`git diff src/cli.ts` and put it back. Read the calls in order: it read, it edited, and then it
checked — and the third one is what makes the first two worth anything.

The two numbers in `bash.ts` are guardrails, and you can watch one of them:

```text
You: run this exact command: sleep 45
→ bash {"command": "sleep 45"}
Assistant: The `sleep 45` command was killed because it exceeded the 30-second execution
timeout. If you need a longer sleep, you can try a shorter duration like `sleep 25`.
```

Nothing told the model about a timeout except the string your own tool sent back. The same is
true of a tool that throws:

```text
You: read the file no/such/file.txt
→ read_file {"path": "no/such/file.txt"}
Assistant: The file no/such/file.txt does not exist, so it cannot be read. The error ENOENT:
no such file or directory indicates the file is missing.
```

Until this lesson that ENOENT killed the agent — an unhandled rejection sitting in `read_file`
since lesson 04, waiting for the first mistyped path.

## Acceptance test

```sh
npm test -- lesson-09
```

## Pressure test

Break one expectation in any test file, make a note for it to edit, then ask for both at once:

```sh
echo 'title: old' > scratch-note.txt
```

```text
You: run the tests, then change the title in scratch-note.txt to new
→ read_file {"path": "package.json"}
→ bash {"command": "npm test 2>&1"}
→ read_file {"path": "scratch-note.txt"}
→ edit_file {"path": "scratch-note.txt", "oldText": "title: old", "newText": "title: new"}
Assistant: Done. Tests: 15 passed, 1 failed (the deliberately broken scratch test).
scratch-note.txt: title changed from old to new.
```

It ran the tests, saw one fail, reported it accurately, and carried on editing as though nothing
had happened. It now has every tool a coding agent has and none of the habits: nothing tells it
that a red test comes before a new edit, or that "done" is a claim you check before you make it.
Tools are what it can do. The last lesson is about what it should do.
