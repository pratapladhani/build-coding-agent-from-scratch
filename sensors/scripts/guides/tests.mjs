    'Not this: asserting the shape of the result, or that it is defined. A mutation that changes every value in that object survives both.',

  'mystery-guest': [
    'Mystery Guest. The value this test depends on is assigned somewhere else, so you cannot read the test from its own body — you have to scroll up, hold the hook in your head, and hope no other test changed it first.',
    'Product code is DRY; test code is WET. Build what the test needs *in* the test, and give the setup a name that reads as a sentence: a Test Data Builder for the value, or a `given…` helper defined below the test in the same file.',
    'A shared mutable binding is also how tests start depending on each other. If two tests need the same object, two builders calling the same defaults is cheaper than one variable they both reach into.',

    'A loop over cases runs every case, so nothing is skipped — but when one fails, the report names the test and not the case, and you are left rerunning it by hand to find out which input broke.',

    'The threshold is a conversation, not a law: a test that genuinely needs a lot of world is telling you the unit under test needs a lot of world, and that is worth hearing before you go quiet.',
    'Not this: moving the statements into a `beforeEach`. The count goes down and the test gets harder to read, because now the setup is invisible from the body.',

    'This asserts that a collaborator was called — how the code worked, not what it did. Rewrite the internals without changing the behaviour and this test fails; break the behaviour while still making the call and it passes.',
    'Assert the outcome instead: what the function returned, what the Fake ended up holding, what the next read of the port produces. A Fake that records enough to be asked a real question is worth more than a spy that counts calls.',
    'Not this: keeping the call assertion "as well, to be safe". It is the one that will fail during a refactoring you were right to make.',
