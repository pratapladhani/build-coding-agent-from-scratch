Nine times in ten the comment is a name nobody wrote — Extract Function until the call reads as the sentence, Rename until the parameter says what it is, Introduce Parameter Object until the clump has a noun. Delete the comment and see whether anything is actually missing.',
    'What survives that is a **why**: a constraint from outside, an alternative rejected, a cost accepted on purpose. If it fits in one line, keep it. If it does not, write it in `context/` and leave a one-line comment pointing there — the doc can hold the reasoning, be linked to, and be found by someone who is not already reading this file.',

    'This is the failure that makes people stop believing comments. Code that lies is caught by a test; prose that lies survives every other sensor in this repository and is read as fact.',

    'If the note is really a warning about a constraint or a trap, rewrite it as one. A comment saying **why** the code is shaped this way earns its place; a comment saying what somebody ought to do later does not.',
