# Build a Coding Agent from Scratch

**Slides and setup — [sdiamante13.github.io/build-coding-agent-from-scratch](https://sdiamante13.github.io/build-coding-agent-from-scratch/)**

You use AI agents every day. Under the hood, every one of them is a while loop, a language
model, and some tools. Over ten short lessons you will build one — no frameworks — until it
can read your code, change it, run your tests, and drive a kata test-first.

## Setup

Node.js 22 or newer, and git.

```sh
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

`.env` is gitignored, so your key stays on your machine. Open it and paste in a key from
[openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys):

```sh
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
OPENROUTER_MODEL=minimax/minimax-m3:free
```

That is the whole setup. `npm start` reads `.env` for you.

### Choosing a model

The default costs nothing, so you can build the whole agent without spending anything — it is
also the least reliable of the four, so if you would rather not lose time to it, put a few
dollars of credit on your OpenRouter account and use `openai/gpt-5.6-luna`. A whole workshop
costs cents. Any model that supports tool calling works; swap `OPENROUTER_MODEL` and nothing
else changes.

| Model                     | Tools | Context | Cost per 1M in/out | Notes                                            |
| ------------------------- | ----- | ------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `openai/gpt-5.6-luna`     | yes   | 1M      | $0.20 / $1.20      | **recommended** — the only one with no known wall |
| `minimax/minimax-m3:free` | yes   | 1M      | free               | the default — free, and asks for a tool 2 runs in 5 |
| `google/gemma-4-31b-it`   | yes   | 256K    | $0.10 / $0.34      | the fastest — but answers from memory about files it thinks it knows |
| `google/gemini-3.7-flash` | yes   | 1M      | $0.38 / $1.88      | **avoid** — breaks in lesson 10                  |

Each of those notes is something that was measured, not guessed:

- **`gpt-5.6-luna`** ran all ten lessons and the pressure tests. Nothing has gone wrong with it.
- **`minimax/minimax-m3:free`** emitted a tool call in 2 of 5 identical one-shot runs — one
  refusal, one 429 with a single caller, and one reply that **invented the file's contents** and
  reported success. Lessons 04 to 10 need a tool call on nearly every turn. It does finish, and
  it will cost you retries.
- **`gemma-4-31b-it`** asks for a tool 5 times in 5, but will not read a file it believes it
  already knows: asked what `src/index.ts` does, it answers fluently, correctly, and without
  ever calling `read_file`. Neither a stronger tool description nor a system prompt moved it.
- **`gemini-3.7-flash`** passes every preflight check and then dies part-way through lesson 10
  with `Corrupted thought signature.` Gemini 3.x attaches encrypted reasoning to its replies and
  wants it back byte-exact next request — a round trip this agent does not do and the lessons do
  not teach. The failure arrives after nine lessons of everything working.

## The lessons

The five screens used in the session — getting set up, the agentic loop, tool calling, this
lesson map, and how coach mode works — are at
[sdiamante13.github.io/build-coding-agent-from-scratch](https://sdiamante13.github.io/build-coding-agent-from-scratch/), or in
[`docs/index.html`](docs/index.html) if you have already cloned. Use the arrow keys.

Each lesson adds one capability, then runs into the wall that motivates the next one. That
wall is the point: you feel the limitation before you hear the fix.

| #   | Lesson                 | What you add                                   | What still hurts                                    |
| --- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | `single-turn`          | one API call, print the reply, exit            | you cannot ask a follow-up                          |
| 2   | `agent-loop`           | the loop — prompt, reply, repeat               | it forgets everything you just said                 |
| 3   | `conversation`         | keep the messages and resend them              | it cannot see your code                             |
| 4   | `read-file`            | a tool: schema, dispatch, tool result          | ask for two files and one is silently dropped       |
| 5   | `observability`        | a session log, and tool calls on screen        | now you can watch it drop the second one            |
| 6   | `parallel-calls`       | run every tool call in the message             | it reads, then stops — it cannot act on what it saw |
| 7   | `tool-call-loop`       | keep going until the model stops calling tools | it understands your code but cannot change it       |
| 8   | `edit-file`            | exact-match edits                              | it edits blind — it cannot run the tests            |
| 9   | `bash`                 | run commands, feed the output back             | powerful, but with no method                        |
| 10  | `coding-system-prompt` | the prompt that makes it work test-first       | nothing — point it at the kata                      |

**The finale:** the rules are in [`kata/bowling/README.md`](kata/bowling/README.md). Start your
agent with `npm start` and give it this:

```text
Read kata/bowling/README.md and build the bowling scorer test-first.
Run `npm run kata` to check your work.
```

Nothing in that says how to work. That comes from the system prompt you wrote in lesson 10, and
this is where you find out whether it took. `npm run kata` runs that folder alone, so a
half-finished scorer never turns your lesson tests red. You are not expected to finish — three
rules green, written test-first, is the exercise working.

The folder holds one file, so your agent has to make the rest. Watch what it does, and watch for
the three ways it goes wrong: writing the code before the test, making a failing test pass by
editing the test, and saying it is done without running anything. When it does one of those, the
system prompt is the thing to change — not the code.

## Get started

Open your coding agent in this directory and say **"preflight"** — it checks Node, your key,
and that your model can actually call tools, which is the failure that otherwise waits until
lesson 4 to surface.

Then say **"coach me"**. It reads the ledger in [`docs/specs`](docs/specs), finds the first
lesson that is not done, and walks you through it one small step at a time. If you would rather
it wrote the code, say **"jfdi"**.

Claude Code, Codex, Copilot CLI, Cursor and pi all work. Each reads
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) on its own and follows it to [`.agents/`](.agents), so the session is
the same whichever you brought — no per-agent setup.

**Using Codex?** Start it with `codex --yolo`. Codex sandboxes a fresh clone as `read-only`,
and trusting the folder only gets you as far as `workspace-write` with the network still shut —
which blocks the loopback server the acceptance tests run on, so every lesson's test times out.
`--yolo` turns the sandbox off and the tests pass.

If you would rather keep the sandbox, trust the folder and add this to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[sandbox_workspace_write]
network_access = true
```

A `.codex/config.toml` inside the repo does not work — Codex only reads the one in your home
directory.

Run the agent you are building at any point:

```sh
npm start
```

From lesson 2 on it keeps asking until you stop it. Ctrl-C or Ctrl-D both quit cleanly.

Check your work against the lesson you are on:

```sh
npm test
```

Lessons you have not built yet stay red — that is the ledger, not a problem. A fresh clone
starts with nine red suites and they go green one lesson at a time.

## Falling behind

Every lesson has a tag on the `solution` branch. Take the working version of the lesson you are
stuck on and keep going — the `-- src/` matters, it copies those files in and leaves the rest of
your work alone:

```sh
git checkout lesson-4-read-file -- src/
```

Look at what changed between two of them to see a lesson in one screen:

```sh
git diff lesson-3-conversation lesson-4-read-file
```

## Repo map

- `docs/specs/` — the ledger and one spec per lesson
- `src/` — the agent you are growing. `index.ts` is the agent, `cli.ts` the terminal,
  `llm.ts` the model call. Lesson 1 is already here
- `test/` — an acceptance test per lesson, and the fake model they run against
- `docs/index.html` — the five screens used in the session, published at the link above
- `kata/bowling/` — the finale. One README and nothing else; your agent writes the rest
- `sensors/` — authoring tooling for the maintainers. Not part of the workshop; ignore it.
